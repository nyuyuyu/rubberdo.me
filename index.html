	ok so first fuck you topre isnt 'just an expensive rubber dome'<br /> 

	each key has a spring that acts as a capacitor and uses a timing circuit to determine how far the key is pressed down making it not a switch at all<br /> 
	topre keyboards can technically work even if their domes are taken out, as the domes provide nothing but smooth tactility
	
	with topre you do not need to bottom out to actuate, unlike a membrane, and uses high quality domes to ensure that your typing experience doesn't suck<br /> 
	it's impossible to be mushy as it does not use the conductive pad that membranes use, so bottoming out is solid and crisp<br /> 
	
	it's smoother than nearly any mechanical option and can be modified somewhat easily<br /> 
	with an easily upgraded spacebar, the keycaps are among the best available<br /> <br /> 
	
	if that's not worth $200, no keyboard is
